# Chiado TokenBridge / Deployment
Ansible playbooks for deploying cross-chain bridges.

## Overview
Please refer to the [POA TokenBridge](../README.md) overview first of all.

These playbooks are designed to automate the deployment process for cross-chain bridges on bridge validator nodes. This process installs the bridge as a service and sets .env configurations on a remote server.

## Requirements

Make sure you have set up and enabled ANSIBLE_VAULT, which is used to encrypt/decrypt environment variables that need to stay secret:
- Clone the repository
- Create a .vault_pass file in the root path of the repo
- Fill the .vault_pass with a password of your choice
- Edit your .bashrc or .zshrc file and set `export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=./.vault_pass`

## Configuration

Please refer to [Configuration](./CONFIGURATION.md).

## Execution

Please refer to [Execution](./EXECUTION.md).

## Testing

Please refer to [Deployment-E2E](../deployment-e2e/README.md).
